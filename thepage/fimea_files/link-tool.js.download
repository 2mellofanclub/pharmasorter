 * rel="noopener" prevents the new page from being able to access the window.opener property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
 * rel="noreferrer" has the same effect but also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page. See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noreferrer.
 *
 * This will improve performance and security because new pages are running in a separate process which does not have access to window.opener property. https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/
